# Minsky Tutorial

These tutorials illustrate different ways you can use the Minsky cluster to run deep learning algorithms (or anything that uses a GPU).

The tutorials assume a few things.

1. You are familiar and comfortable using the terminal in a Unix-like environment. Minsky does not offer GUI or Windows support.
2. Your project is under source control (such as git) that you can use to push changes to the minsky cluster in a clean way.
3. You are familiar with Python at a level more than beginner.
4. You are comfortable with using Docker if you intend to use Docker containers.
